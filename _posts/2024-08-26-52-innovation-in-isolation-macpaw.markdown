description: "Innovation in Isolation is a book about little-known events that were hidden from the world behind the Iron Curtain. Separated from the technical and scientific base of the world, bright scientists and engineers were forced to think creatively “inside the box” of a system that didn’t encourage that. They gathered in Kyiv to create a liberal scientific culture, where the latest approaches and experiments are encouraged to this day. Here you can have a sneak peek at the achievements of these men and women who demonstrated unprecedented resilience and ingenuity in creating the first computers.
Read the book to discover twists and turns in the Soviet experience with cybernetics within the skepticism of a totalitarian system, tricky machinations of colleagues, alliance forging, and institution building. Demystify what impact the Ukrainian school of cybernetics had on the vibrant modern IT industry of Ukraine and the world."
